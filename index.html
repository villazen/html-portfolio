    <h1>Brief History Of Green Computing </h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><p>The history of green computing can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when concerns about the environmental impact of computing began to emerge. Here are some significant milestones in the history of green computing:
                The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the Energy Star program in 1992 to encourage the development and use of energy-efficient technology.
                The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive came into effect in 2006, banning the use of specific hazardous substances in electronic products.
               In 2007, the Climate Savers Computing Initiative (CSCI) was launched with the aim of reducing the energy consumption of computing systems and promoting energy-efficient technology.
               In 2010, the Green Grid, a global consortium of companies, was formed to promote energy efficiency in data centers.

    <h2>WHY GO GREEN? </h2>
    <P>Computing power consumption of companies has reached a critical point. For example, an E commerce business with 100,000 servers can easily spend up to $20 million a year on server power. Add another $10 million for a/c cooling and it tops $30 million a year in power alone. Clearly there is a huge potential for savings in their infrastructure. Below are the reasons to green ITC:</P>   
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p> 1.Climate Change: First and foremost, conclusive research shows that CO2 and other emissions are causing global climate and environmental damage. Preserving the planet is a valid goal because it aims to preserve life. Planets like ours, that supports life, are very rare. None of the planets in our solar system, or in nearby star systems have m-class planets as we know them.</P> 
                <P> 2.Savings: Green computing can lead to serious cost savings over time. Reductions in energy costs from servers, cooling, and lighting are generating serious savings for many corporations.</P>      
                  <P> 3.Reliability of Power: As energy demands in the world go up, energy supply is declining or flat. Energy efficient systems helps ensure healthy power systems. Also, more companies are generating more of their own electricity, which further motivates them to keep power consumption low.
                  </P>  
                  <P>4.Computing Power Consumption has reached a Critical Point: Data centres have run out of usable power and cooling due to high densities.
                  </P>
                  <P>5.It‚Äôs not easy being not green: In recent years, news coverage has exposed deep holes in many company sustainability initiatives, raising concerns about high cost infrastructure changes and the validity of overseas carbon offset programs. Replacing of office equipment can be time- and cost- intensive. But making existing equipment more energy-efficient is a fast and easy process that pays off within months, and makes it difficult being not green.
                  </P> 
                  <P>6.Sustained growth requires sustainable operations: Putting a computer in sleep mode during inactive times can cut energy use on average 60-70 
                      percent and up to 90 percent in aggressive scenarios. As the company grows and as demands on IT and PC networks increase, getting control over energy use will become an important advantage.
                      </P>
                      <P> 7.Energy-efficient IT is high performance IT: IT equipment can account for nine percent of all energy consumed by businesses- the third-largest source of power for the commercial sector. Putting power management policies in place is the easiest way to control power consumption across any network.
                      </P>
                      <P>  8.Lower exposure to energy prices: Energy sales are expected to grow 50 percent worldwide by 2030. By reducing the amount of power required to operate the business, one can mitigate risk from factors well outside of control.
                          Improved reputation and brand value:  Investing in a strong sustainability program (which can be led with Green IT) and communicating the value to your customers and stakeholders can do wonders for one‚Äôs reputation and brand.

   <h2>Charateristics Of Green Computing</h2>
   <p>Green computing has several characteristics that differentiate it from traditional computing. Here are some of the key characteristics of green computing:

    Energy efficiency: Green computing aims to reduce the energy consumption of computing systems through the use of energy-efficient hardware and power management techniques.</p>
    <p>Sustainability: Green computing promotes sustainable practices in the design, development, and use of computing systems to minimize the environmental impact of computing.</p>
     <p>Waste reduction: Green computing aims to reduce electronic waste by promoting the reuse and recycling of computing hardware.
    </p> 
    <p>Resource optimization: Green computing seeks to optimize the use of computing resources, such as memory, storage, and processing power, to reduce the overall energy consumption of computing systems.
    </p>
    <p>Carbon footprint reduction: Green computing aims to reduce the carbon footprint of computing by minimizing the use of non-renewable energy sources and promoting the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.
    </p>
    <p>Social responsibility: Green computing recognizes the social responsibility of the computing industry to reduce its environmental impact and promote sustainable practices.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, the characteristics of green computing reflect a commitment to environmental sustainability, resource optimization, and social responsibility. These principles guide the design, development, and use of computing systems that minimize the environmental impact of computing
         while promoting energy efficiency and sustainability.</p>
